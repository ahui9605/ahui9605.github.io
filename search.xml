        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Final-Paper-Idea"><a href="#Final-Paper-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Final Paper Idea"></a>Final Paper Idea</h3><p><em>Live Sign Interpreter Anywhere</em></p><p>This is just a “pop-up” idea that I discussed in class on Thursday where I had already discussed it. It is basically a software or a plug-in that can be added to a web browser. The function is the interpreter can be toggled on and off at any time for people with disabilities who are having a negative experience or are having trouble gathering information on a computer or a television, such as watching a video or video chatting, reading a short article, or reading comments. The live time interpreter can appear in a small window in the lower-right corner of the screen and provide assistance to users at any time; alternatively, the window can be dragged to any location the user finds more convenient.</p><p><em>Closed Interpreting Accessibility Revision</em></p><p>A project in which I worked with my partner and two mentors on REU internship experiences during the summer. It is about how Sign Language Interpreters are not readily available on television or in online media. Our project offers an application programming interface (API) known as AblePlayer, and we made some modifications to this API in order to make it more supportive of features related to sign interpreters window. Considering that this project has already been completed, however, I would like to provide some revised feedbacks and make some alterations to the CIA concept. Therefore, I will eliminate some of the superfluous features, such as the transparency functions, and ensure that the sign interpreter windows do not have an excessive amount of transparency. I will also try to fix those bugs where they still existed right now.</p><p><em>Web Browser Background Color</em></p><p>The use of well-known web browsers such as Chrome, Firefox, and Edge have become an integral part of our daily lives. We rely on them on a daily basis to carry out both our productive and entertaining work. But for those individuals who suffer from a condition known as color sensitivity, which makes it uncomfortable for them to view backgrounds of black and white or a particular color. Even though some browsers provide a daytime and nighttime mode, the primary goal of this feature was originally to safeguard the eyes. So there is a tool that needs to be made public and utilized in order to assist those individuals who are color sensitive. A good idea could be to change the sensitive color set by the users, including the different website background, or a particular area for decoration, or even all images and diagrams. This would be an example of how this could be used. The sensitive color will be changed to an alternative color, but the other colors will remain unchanged.</p><h3 id="Based-on-Few-Advices-to-Made-Modifications-on-Able-Player"><a href="#Based-on-Few-Advices-to-Made-Modifications-on-Able-Player" class="headerlink" title="Based on Few Advices to Made Modifications on Able Player"></a>Based on Few Advices to Made Modifications on Able Player</h3><h4 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h4><p>Sign Language in the media, either on-site or remotely, is provided to people who are Deaf and hard of hearing to be informed about critical information and other critical information in their daily lives. Access to Sign Language on TV or online media is not a requirement outlined within the ADA. . Deaf users are still using closed captions as their alternative options for watching TV and other media (Liu &amp; Lam, 2022). To promote quality accessibility, my previous project developed Able Player (Liu &amp; Lam, 2022), an accessible tool similar to closed captioning that will be displayed with an sign interpreter video that can be toggled on and off. This closed interpreting tool is user adjustable. It contains settings such as interpreter window size, transparency, and moveable window. All of which can be adjusted by the user. My project (Liu &amp; Lam, 2022) received numerous feedback, such as some areas of the user interface design needing to be corrected, where I need to continue to work on more about this part, and some buttons needing more detail, some developers might want to use the API, because I made a lot of modifications on the original Able Player, so a manual is required in order to provide clear instructional guidelines for using the API. This study aims to evaluate the modified Able Player tool and provide a instructional manual how to use the API for the web developer. The IRB approval is still needed where it involves human research, and I will work with more if time permits after getting approval.</p><h4 id="Introductoin"><a href="#Introductoin" class="headerlink" title="Introductoin"></a>Introductoin</h4><p>The utilization of accessibility has grown as a result of the fast development of high-speed transmission and video technology. Deaf and hard of hearing people are increasingly adapting to acquire information from television shows, films and websites. Thus, accessibility such as captions both in closed captions and open captions are become very important where deaf and hard of hearing people are rely on them as a very valuable tool for translating spoken language. (Liu &amp; Lam, 2022). However, the captions as the major accessibility are still an “ad-hoc” for deaf and hard of hearing. One example is the YouTube Video where it was designed to those who speak, read and write English very well and it is only use as the alternative option to replace aural information to many deaf viewers and they find it very difficult to follow because the speed of verbatim captioning is likely to exceed their reading abilities . Even after controlling for reading level, deaf students learned less from on-screen text than hearing peers. They prefer ASL interpreters over closed captions, partially because they find captions difficult to understand and partly because they receive less information (Debevc et al., 2015).</p><p>I had another option where it provided the PIP (Picture in Picture)mode with the sign language interpreter on TV and internet vides. However, the media tends to crop out the screen of the interpreter if it is even available to all, which prevents the DHH viewer from getting full access to information. Providing PIP on a few channels or sources achieves critical mass, albeit with limited success. If not properly set up, it might be difficult for the deaf audience to see what is being spoken, resulting in incomplete communication. It only caters to the DHH community on a limited level, therefore this issue may be difficult for DHH individuals because the media is hearing-centric, and they have little experience with sign language translating on TV (Liu &amp; Lam, 2022).</p><h4 id="Methodology"><a href="#Methodology" class="headerlink" title="Methodology"></a>Methodology</h4><p>The research will be split into two parts: one will concentrate on the user experience and user interface, while the other will be geared toward website developers. Both the user and the viewer will have a better experience watching content that is more accessible if a good instruction on how to utilize the Able Player API for website developers is provided. The steps outlined below are broken up into two parts. The first step is to write a manual, it will be referred to by the person responsible for developing the website in order to correctly configure and install the Able Player there. The second option is a modified version of Able Player, which has had bugs corrected and unnecessary functionalities removed allow user to watch without any problem.</p><p><em>Able Player Manual:</em><br>I created and participated on a project that offered a more accessible media player, called Able Player, and allowed users to use it whenever they wanted. However, there are still some problems with this project, so I made some improvements to the accessible media player to make it more user-friendly and accessible for everyone after the survey and Q&amp;A interview session on that project. Additionally, I want to ensure that the web developers can use this encapsulated API to set up all of the functionality without any issues. Therefore, a detailed manual is necessary to utilize in order to expand on how to use the Able Player as needed.<br>The manual will be included:</p><ul><li>General instructions</li><li>Purpose of making this modification</li><li>The reference documents</li><li>API environment requirements</li><li>Assistance and problem reporting</li><li>Common issues where developer encounters</li><li>License</li></ul><p><em>Survey:</em><br>I intend to get in touch with the previous participants who volunteered their time and see if they would be interested in coming back to try out my improved version of the Able Player. It is my expectation that there will be approximately two to three persons there, and that number will be sufficient for me. If there is enough time, I could ask one or two website developers to participate in this research study as new participants and then show them my API along with the manual that I just finished writing for the project. The survey will be use in Google Form and will be analyzed after the usability test done. It will include five multiple-choice questions, and respondents will be asked to rank each question on a scale from 1 to 5 based on the degree to which they agree with the statement that they are reading. Also, there will be a open-discussion Q&amp;A that ask participants for their feedback regarding this project and the modification that I had been made.</p><h4 id="Evaluation"><a href="#Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation"></a>Evaluation</h4><p>It is intended that I will spend around ten minutes with each participant, explaining the various informed consent forms either in American Sign Language (ASL) or spoken English. They are going to be provided with a general explanation of the goal of this research.</p><p>I will supply each participant with a laptop, and they will all meet in a room individually. They are free to bring own computer. However, their computer must be capable of running Chrome Version 109.0.5xx or a later version, as well as Microsoft Edge Version 95.x or the most recent version. I will supply the pre-set Able Player with the videos that were used in the previous project, along with the American Sign Language interpreter. At this time, I will make it shorter by only requiring one video to watch from each participant, and the topic will be the same throughout. The video #3: Gas Price in Los Angeles from the previous project will be use to all participants in Figure 1:</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure2.png" title="Figure 1: Example of an Early Able Player Media Version"></p><p>Because I was not funded by any organization or funding support, none of the participants will receive any compensation for their time spent participating in the usability study. The replies of all participants in both the usability study and the survey were kept strictly confidential and were only meant to be discussed between the researcher I am working on this project.</p><h4 id="Result"><a href="#Result" class="headerlink" title="Result"></a>Result</h4><p>The approval of the IRB is a significant obstacle given that this study includes variables of human research. For now, I should wait to get the IRB approval to move forward with the evaluation and research test. From the Able Player itself in the survey from my previous project, a number of the participants reported that they had a favorable opinion of the media player use. We conducted our research with a total of 10 participants, and we utilized the same survey for each round of usability testing. In order to assess and present the results, we used an Excel chart generating tool to depict each participant’s responses. The scores for individual participants and different hearing status groups of participants were examined shown in Figure 2, and the scores for most participants were medium-high level which is considering a great and useful media player to them.</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure3.1.png" title="Figure 2: A Chart of the System Usability Scale Calculation by Score"></p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Because the modified version of Able Player in version 1.0 received a great deal more positive feedback, I do expect to have a successful outcome with the modified version of Able Player. Also, I am unsure whether the web developer will find the handbook to be understandable or not. Therefore, I still require further time to figure out.</p><h4 id="The-Innovation-of-Speech-English-to-Auto-Generating-Sign-Language-Interpreting"><a href="#The-Innovation-of-Speech-English-to-Auto-Generating-Sign-Language-Interpreting" class="headerlink" title="The Innovation of Speech English to Auto Generating Sign Language Interpreting"></a>The Innovation of Speech English to Auto Generating Sign Language Interpreting</h4><p>All sign interpreting is pre-recorded and prepared for usage in the Able Player or other media source in accordance with the WCAG 2.1 Guideline. However, where the WCAG does not include it with the auto-generating sign interpreting similar to the auto-generating captions.</p><p>When you want to make accessibility features for the DHH community, it is a big problem because you have to hire certified sign language interpreters and have video editing skills to ensure that the DHH audience has the best possible watching experience. If more videos are provided about the website’s development, the budget might increase to a significant amount. The captions had the exact same problem in the very beginning stage, but thanks to improvements in closed captioning with more advanced technology, there are now captions that are automatically generated and support a variety of languages. It works with speech recognition technology, which enables the computer to listen like a human, generate captions, and display captions on screen.</p><p>The future will have high accuracy AI technology that can do anything a computer can. The idea is the same with sign interpreting as well because it serves the same purpose of translating speech English into another language. For instance, the official Chinese Central Television (CCTV) successfully used AI interpreting in 2021 in conjunction with Chinese sign language recognition with different recognition algorithm (Gao et al., 2022). I believe the future will use this concept of AI technology to create better DHH accessibility and the least amount of work possible for website developer without any additional process.</p><h4 id="Future-Works"><a href="#Future-Works" class="headerlink" title="Future Works"></a>Future Works</h4><p>There were technological concerns that necessitated the assistance of additional UI and UX professional consultants and specialists, such as incorporating a new design style on a dropdown menu. A professional can provide far more beneficial recommendations. While working on this enormous project since 2014, more than three or four individuals are also encouraged to contribute to the future development of Able Player. It is my expectation and encouragement that more people will use this Able Player tool to increase accessibility because it is a wonderful tool to use as needed requiring less work and develop time and also followed with the WCAG. I hope that more people will use this tool, and I will encourage them to do so.</p><p>Another significant problem that my project team ran into was the enormous amount of time required to work on the sign interpreting videos. I am expecting to wait for the concept of auto generating AI sign interpreting where they can release the open-source API that website developer can use it with support for American sign language. The amount of work can be significantly decreased.</p><h4 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h4><table>    <tr>        <td>Bosch-Baliarda, M., Soler-Vilageliu, O., & Orero, P.

Among the most significant variations are:</p><ul><li>Feedback: Direct touch screen interaction is an input method where users enter commands by touching the screen with their fingers. Users can enter commands by speaking aloud or using gestures with VoiceOver or TalkBack.</li><li>Direct touch screen interaction provides users with visual feedback that they can see by staring at the screen. Users who use VoiceOver or TalkBack hear spoken words or other sounds as auditory feedback.</li><li>Navigation: With direct touch screen interaction, users swipe or tap the screen to move around the user interface. Users can use voice commands or gestures to navigate when using VoiceOver or TalkBack.</li><li>Accessibility: Users with specific disabilities, such as those who are blind or have low vision, may find direct touch screen interaction inaccessible. On the other hand, VoiceOver and TalkBack are specifically made for people who have vision problems, and they offer accessibility features like text-to-speech, screen magnification, and braille support.</li></ul><p>Overall, the input method, feedback, navigation, and accessibility are the main differences between direct touch screen interaction and interaction using VoiceOver or TalkBack on iOS or Android devices. These variations may have an impact on the user experience and may necessitate that users change how they interact with the device in order to make the most of it.</p></li><li><p><b>Describe at least four problems that may arise in using Youtube’s automatic speech recognition feature.</b></p><p>When using YouTube’s automatic speech recognition (ASR) feature, a number of issues could occur. These issues might make it difficult for users to use the ASR feature effectively and may affect the accuracy and value of the transcriptions. Among the crucial issues are:</p><ul><li>Accurate transcription: Using ASR technology presents a number of challenges, including the need for high accuracy in the transcription of spoken words. ASR systems occasionally make transcription errors, which can lead to inaccurate or deceptive transcriptions.</li><li>Background noise: ASR can have trouble accurately transcribing speech in the presence of background noise, which is another issue with the technology. For instance, the ASR system might struggle to accurately transcribe the speech if there is music or other background noise in a video.</li><li>Different accents and languages: Because ASR systems are typically trained on a particular accent and language, they may struggle to accurately transcribe speech in these situations. Users with different accents or who speak different languages may find it difficult to use the ASR feature as a result, which can result in inaccurate transcriptions.</li><li>Limited functionality: ASR systems are primarily used to transcribe speech and do not typically offer any other features. For instance, speaker identification or other contextual information cannot be automatically generated by ASR systems in captions. As a result, the transcriptions may be less useful and may be more challenging for users to comprehend and utilize effectively.</li></ul></li><li><p><b>Explain what is ARIA – and give at least two examples.</b></p><p>The Accessible Rich Internet Applications Suite (ARIA), is a set of technical guidelines that specify how to make web content and web applications more accessible to people with disabilities. Web developers can use other web accessibility standards like HTML and CSS to create more inclusive and user-friendly web experiences by utilizing ARIA attributes and roles.</p><p>The following are some instances of ARIA attributes and roles:</p><ul><li>Using the “aria-label” attribute, you can give a text label to a web page element like a button or form field. This can aid users who are blind in comprehending the function of the element and interacting with it appropriately.</li><li>Use the “role” attribute to specify an element’s function or purpose on a web page. An element’s “role” attribute, for instance, can be used to specify whether it’s a form field, a button, or a navigation menu. This can make it easier for users with disabilities to interact with the website and understand its organization and structure.</li></ul></li><li><p><b>Give four improvements in WCAG 3.0 over 2.x, per the article, “The Future of Web Accessibility”.</b></p><p>Some of the features from WCAG2.1 will be carried over to the new standard, but there will also be some new features. But since the standard has changed from A, AA, and AAA to a number score. It is the number that goes from the lowest possible score on the standard to the highest possible score. Its purpose is to show how important and necessary it is to measure accessibility. It is more flexible, which made it easier for both users and developers to understand how to measure the accessibility standard. It also made the product easier to use.</p><p>Because the WCAG2.x standard is hard to fully understand, the readability will be changed in a big way. So, the members are thinking about adding symbols and letters that are easier to understand and make more sense so that people who are reading the WCAG for the first time can understand it quickly. It is possible, among other things, to get rid of some unnecessary contexts and rebuild the category class.</p><p>The standard has also been made stricter, such that if one fatal had been made, even if it’s just one fatal mistake, the corresponding standard will drop down to a score of zero, and it will be marked as inaccessible.<br>It adds a new standard known as conformance, which rates websites as Bronze, Silver, or Gold according to the WCAG3.0 Draft. The WCAG3.0 minimum requirement for conformance is called bronze, and the best conformance level is called gold. Bronze is the lowest level of conformance that can be achieved.</p></li><li><p><b>Per the article, “Accessible Images For When They Matter Most”, explain why it is appropriate for some images to be labeled “Decorative Images” and therefore does not need to be described.</b></p><p>Some images should be called “decorative images” and not be described because they don’t give the user any important information or functionality. Most of the time, decorative images are used for their looks, like to add visual interest or improve the look of a web page. They don’t help the user understand or interact with the content. So, it’s not necessary to explain what these images are because they don’t do anything useful and aren’t important to the user’s experience.</p><p>Labeling an image as “decorative” can help people with disabilities who use tools like screen readers to get to web content. When a screen reader comes across an image that has been marked as decorative, it can be set to ignore it and not try to describe it. This can help the user see less information that isn’t important or isn’t relevant and make it easier for them to focus on the most important information. So, calling images “decorative” is the right thing to do when they don’t give the user any important information or functionality. This can help make web content more accessible and easier to use for people with disabilities.</p></li><li><p><b>In the article, “Keyboard-only” Navigation for Improved Accessibility, explain why they recommend using a “Skip Navigation Link”.</b></p><p>Putting a “skip navigation link” on a web page is a good idea because it can make the page easier for people with disabilities to access and use. A skip navigation link is a link that lets users skip a web page’s main navigation menu and go straight to the main content. This can be especially helpful for users who need help getting to web content, like those who use screen readers.</p><p>Screen readers usually read web content in a straight line, from the top of the page to the bottom. This means that people who use screen readers must hear the whole navigation menu before they can get to the page’s main content. This can take time and be annoying, especially if the user knows the site well and already knows where they want to go. Users can skip the navigation menu and go straight to the content they want to see with a “skip navigation” link. This makes it easier and faster for them to find the information they need.</p><p>Overall usability and access for people with disabilities of a website by giving users a way to get around the main navigation menu, “skip navigation” links can make it easier and faster for them to get to the content they want. They can also make the user experience better and less frustrating. These links can be especially helpful for people who use assistive technology like screen readers or who have trouble navigating the web with a mouse or other pointing device. Because of this, skip navigation links are often recommended as a best practice for making web content more accessible.</p></li></ol>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>To the STM403 Managers:<br>We are delighted that our project was chosen, and we are honored to have the chance to discuss the concept of our initiative here. It is evident that you are looking for an enthusiastic group team that can be depended upon to completely engage with the role and develop professionally in a self-motivated manner. We are excited to bring this project to a close since it has the potential to have a tremendous influence not only on the Gallaudet University campus but also on the campuses of other universities.</p><p>This initiative was conceived to enhance and motivate students, as well as bring them into a brighter future in terms of their education in general and their physical education in particular. We understand our student urgently needs a solution for an application. That’s why our STM group is attempting to develop and improve a comprehensive approach to app development that takes guessing out of the game. We’re ecstatic that you’re considering working as a partner with us. The following proposition will outline a strategy for proceeding with the project from the beginning to the conclusion. We are confident that we will completely understand the process and the anticipated amount of time needed to complete the task. I am sure you will acknowledge the information we gave and the high quality of the standards.<br>If you have any questions regarding our project you’d like to discuss, we would be more than happy to meet with you for clarification.<br>Sincerely,<br>Abraham, Charles, Obaidullah, and Zehui</p><h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>Numerous studies reveal a marked drop in physical activity participation and increased sedentary behavior among young adults during the college years (Calestine et al.,.2017). Due to a lack of fitness, health education, and workout equipment, more than half of university students in the United States do not engage in enough physical activity to improve their health, despite being motivated to lose weight or gain muscle (Wharton et al., 2008). Therefore, the appropriate interventions and guidelines are needed to measure and support student’s physical activity. Our project aims to promote quality fitness for our Gallaudet University students. We set aside some time to investigate the drawbacks of Gallaudet fitness and determine the areas that could most benefit from improvement. We used the ACSM (The American College of Sports Medicine) as the reference to coming up with an early development mobile app that allows our users to use the guideline with a simplified approach effectively. This project aims to understand our users’ opinions about fitness in university physical fitness centers and mobile fitness apps. We tried to collect some feedback on the performance of our newly developed fitness application in terms of several variables, including interface designs, workout instructions, ease of use, and accessibility. A group of participants will be given access to our application. We collect feedback from them to see if our application design is practical and capable from their point of view. We anticipate getting additional findings, at which point we can continue providing analysis, whether critical or complimentary, on many fitness-related subjects. It is possible that we will not be able to offer the final results due to unforeseen reasons, including the delay of the IRB approval. But what can be seen is that there are numerous trending and well-liked fitness applications, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic (Cugusi et al., 2021), so we expected the mobile fitness app that including ACSM guidelines for fitness instruction, which would be advantageous to all users and worthy of continued development by future handovers.</p><h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p><em>Background:</em><br>Daily physical activity, including mobile phone apps related to physical activity and exercise, provides various health benefits and is one of the recommendations for addressing lifestyle-related diseases in the United States (Guo et al., 2022). Regular physical activity can reduce the risk of many diseases and even death. It can also lower the risk of mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, or other mental diseases. With the speedy development of mobile technologies, mobile apps related to physical activity have a great potential to improve participation rates in exercise programs (Gowin et al., 2015, Grave, 2020).<br>Exercise guidelines are set forth by the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM). ACSM recommends that the frequency, intensity, time, and type (FITT) principle be followed for any exercise program to have health benefits and avoid injuries (Thompson, 2013, Guo et al., 2022). The ACSM principles of exercise prescription recommend three main components. These principal components are aerobic exercise, strength and resistance, and flexibility. These components play a significant role in improving health. In fact, no apps scored inadequately against the ACSM exercise prescription guidelines (Guo et al., 2022).<br>Furthermore, nutrients also play a substantial role in mental and physical health. Some studies showed that diet and nutrition are essential for physiology and body composition. Not only that, but they also significantly affect mood and mental well-being (Muscaritoli, 2021). According to the National Institute of Health, several data have found a relationship between nutrition, physical fitness, and mental health. Nutrients and physical activity are the agents for prevention, treatment, or augmentation of treatment for mental disorders in children, adolescents, and adults (Grave, 2020, Muscaritoli, 2021).</p><p><em>Mobile Application Background:</em><br>A program that carries out specific tasks is an application or app. It is now an essential component of our life. Apps can be accessed on various mobile computing platforms, making using and accessing them simple. The apps were initially intended to be used for mail, contacts, calendars, etc., but due to increased public demand, they were expanded to include mobile games, GPS services, recharge, and ticket booking options, and fitness services, resulting in millions of apps that are now available on different application distribution platforms. (Hoon et al,. 2013). Apps can assist with setting fitness objectives, offering exercise suggestions, monitoring calorie intake, offering workout recipes, and offering progress graphs. Using the data one provides, apps also offer tailored advice. Numerous factors, including increased privacy, accessibility, time constraints, and lower costs compared to fitness centers, have contributed to the growth of app usage (Tong, H.L. et al. 2022).<br>An application can improve accessibility for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Many mobile apps rely on audio instructions and communication, which can be difficult for deaf individuals to access and understand. By incorporating ASL interpreters, a mobile app can provide visual, rather than auditory, instructions and communication, making it much more accessible and user-friendly for deaf individuals. Another benefit of a mobile app with ASL interpreters is that it can help to promote inclusivity and accessibility in various industries and situations. Deaf individuals may often feel excluded or disadvantaged when accessing information and services due to the reliance on auditory communication. The data shows that the ASL interpreters scored 3.72 out of 5, which is the second-highest accessibility use in mobile health (mHealth) apps (Romero* et al., 2019). By providing ASL interpreters, a mobile app can help break down these barriers by providing ASL interpreters and making information and services more inclusive for deaf individuals.</p><h3 id="Issues"><a href="#Issues" class="headerlink" title="Issues"></a>Issues</h3><p>There is no current app for Gallaudet athletes and non-athlete students to access ASL information related to activity, training, and nutrition. There is no platform for visual workout lesson plans with ASL accessible where coaches can create their plans and assign the team to follow the process. Non-athlete students have limited access to the Gallaudet fitness center due to a lack of hours. They have less knowledge of fitness and nutrition due to a lack of a fitness coach or guide leader on how to exercise and food properly. We want to ensure that Gallaudet Community has access to fitness and nutrition information to reduce physical and mental health risks.</p><h3 id="Approach"><a href="#Approach" class="headerlink" title="Approach"></a>Approach</h3><p>In today’s busy world, many people struggle to find the time and motivation to maintain a regular fitness routine. A mobile fitness app can provide users with a convenient way to track their progress and see their improvements over time. The app can also provide reminders and notifications to help users stay on track with their fitness goals. A fitness app can also provide users with a wide range of fitness-related information and resources. This can include exercise demonstrations, workout plans, nutrition guides, and other helpful tools. By providing users with all of the information and resources they need to achieve their fitness goals, a fitness app can be a valuable tool for improving overall health and wellness (Gowin et al., 2014). Another important purpose of a mobile fitness app is to help users connect with others who have similar fitness goals. One research shows that sharing workout progress and data with others can be an excellent motivator for many people to continue exercising where it provides a sense of accountability (Ehrlén, 2020). Many apps include features that allow users to share their progress and motivate each other, creating a sense of community and support. This can be especially helpful for individuals who are new to fitness or who may be struggling to stay motivated. Overall, there will be many benefits, and the mobile fitness app can provide individuals with a convenient and accessible way to track and improve their physical fitness. These apps can help users achieve their fitness goals and improve their overall health and wellness by offering a wide range of features and resources.</p><h3 id="Objectives-Main-Goals"><a href="#Objectives-Main-Goals" class="headerlink" title="Objectives/Main Goals"></a>Objectives/Main Goals</h3><ul><li>To understand the reason why Gallaudet fitness is lacking services such as coaches and equipment</li><li>To understand whether fitness applications are preferred over fitness centers</li><li>To understand user perspectives about fitness apps</li><li>To understand the popularity of fitness apps among users</li></ul><h3 id="Method"><a href="#Method" class="headerlink" title="Method"></a>Method</h3><p><em>Survey Setup:</em><br>We plan to set up a questionnaire survey at the early testing stage to collect data. To obtain valuable high-level responses and in-depth insights via an interview with each participant at the end of the testing stage will be conducted. This step is to get additional clarification information, answer participants’ confusing questions, and receive feedback on our project idea. Participants will rank each question from 1 to 5 based on how much they agree with the statement they are reading. There are English and ASL versions available for use. The surveys are done through Google form. Due to waiting for IRB approval, we decided to discuss what features and tools will be included in the app design.</p><p><em>Mobile Application Setup:</em><br>To help users understand what they should do about fitness, we integrated our ACSM guidelines into the mobile app. The interface, created with Adobe XD, included information on the workouts, exercises, and dietary intake. Since our applications are still in the early stages of development, only the volunteer participants were permitted to test the app. Fitness apps come in a few main functions to serve the user’s diverse needs:</p><ul><li>Workout Plan - provide users with a goal plan such as a fit body plan, lose weight plan, etc. To help users reach their goals.</li><li>Activity Tracker — Uses mobile sensors to track a person’s daily motions, such as walking, jogging, and running, and then analyzes them for the user.</li><li>Personal Trainer- helping those who do not want to attend fitness classes and those with busy work schedules. The app acts as a fitness coach and lets users create their trains.</li><li>Diet and Nutrition- offering the options best suited to those seeking a balanced diet and who are health-conscious.</li><li>Stretch/workout daily information - helping users to understand what benefits for their physical or mental from stretch/workout</li></ul><p><em>MobileApplication Concept/Design:</em><br>We have three main structures (Figure 1) to make up our application: Home, Plans, and Daily. Each section has features, such as the home section’s recommendation of a workout plan to attract users; the General section is the shortcut for quick start exercise, monitoring activity, and checking gym schedule. It has the personalized workout plan or the suggested plan we offered in the Plans section. The information about meal suggestions and nutrition has been gathered for the Daily section. Additionally, it has an activity tracker that measures the user’s heart rate while exercising and the number of steps you take while running or walking. not just that only, but it also has a nutrient activity tracker with accurate information. This process is the same concept as dietary analysis with MyFitnessPal that has very accurate information with nutrient activity tracker. (Evenepoe et al., 2020).</p><p>hover to see the title text:</p><p>Inline-style:</p><!-- <img src="/images/stm403,figure1.png" alt="Italian Trulli"> --><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure1.PNG" title="Figure 1: The Flowchart Showing the Mobile Application Structure"></p><p>When a user clicks on the exercise video before beginning, the application provides the prerequisites and instructions outlined by ACSM, which are also shown in the exercise video. When describing what should be done and what should not be done, as well as what can be expected after continuing to work out the plan after a week or a month, it must be very specific. These videos embed the various exercises with sign language instructions, and multiple languages are supported, and the workout will begin when the user clicks the play button. Once started, The user can highly customize how their preferred coach is set up, the video size, color background, etc.</p><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure2.png" title="Figure 2: The Diagram of Our Draft Mobile Fitness Application Designed for Sign Up"></p><p>Our IT member simply marked, added, and edited each interface and interaction. This is not a programmed functionality application that involves any programming language. We use Adobe XD, a prototyping tool, to make the user interface, transitions, and interactive buttons with less cost and time.<br>Since the Bison is the proprietary logo of Gallaudet University, we decided to call the app: Bison Fitness once we get the permission to use it. Figure 2 shows a number of ways users can sign up or log in to confirm so we can validate that the user who is attempting to log in is a Gallaudet University student. The user will then be prompted to enter information such as the body emphasis region of emphasis for the exercise, the primary goal of doing this, and which body part they want to gain and grow muscle on.</p><p>Figure 3 shows more interactive options for users, including videos and replays to build muscle or whatever they need. Users can choose a workout method. After the user selects a workout plan, it will show what they need to prepare, such as a yoga mat, dumbbells, a healthy diet, water, or other equipment, before starting. The exercise video and timer will follow. The viewer can pause, skip, and stop the video and request more counts. Rest, then return to the main website to start the next workout level.</p><p>We provide athletes teams with the app in Figure 3, the fifth diagram of the workout lesson can be found by the coach with his set. This app is useful for all Gallaudet athletes teams to track their workout plan/ lesson with the video guideline instructions, including ASL, pictures, etc. These would help them to avoid any injury. When the team was assigned to do a workout lesson created by the coach, they could start the workout by following the instruction. They can’t pretend to finish it by hand. Its app would display the workout video with the time based on the settings made by coaches. The team has to finish their workout lesson before the time out, so it will go on the completed list. Coaches can see whether they are finished or not.</p><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure3.1.png"></p><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure3.2.png" title="Figure 3: The Diagram of Our Draft Workout Choice at Homepage"></p><h3 id="Mobile-Application-Evaluation"><a href="#Mobile-Application-Evaluation" class="headerlink" title="Mobile Application Evaluation"></a>Mobile Application Evaluation</h3><p>The evaluation was set in a few parts (Figure 4). The introduction to the evaluation and training mobile application was set at the beginning. Then came the actual main evaluation session and, finally, the Q&amp;A session. Each participant was notified that there is no compensation for their time during the survey because we do not get support from organizations and departments. All of the things are volunteered. The feedback and survey remained confidential and was only to be shared among group members of this project.</p><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure4.PNG" title="Figure 4: A Flowchart Showing The Process of the Evaluation"></p><ol><li>First, we meet the participants and explain the Informed Consent and Feedback Release form in ASL or spoken English. A general explanation of the project’s purpose was to be shared as follows: “In our STM Project, we are conducting studies of different people’s user experience and feedback on Gallaudet fitness center to promote accessibility for the on-campus/off-campus students and Gallaudet community.”</li><li>The participants will be seated in a room and can use electronic devices (smartphone/laptop) provided by our STM project group or bring their own devices to use.</li><li>The group member will explain the process of how to perform the application on a computer and mobile phone during the evaluation by showing the participants how to use and interact with them. Additionally, participants will expect to complete a Google Form survey and a short interview Q&amp;A within a few minutes.</li><li>The expected time to be completed will be around 10 minutes to finish all the steps in this evaluation. If the participant is interested in the apps, we can provide them with the IPA IOS file to be installed on their phone. They can continue using our app for a week and return later for more feedback.</li></ol><h3 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h3><p>Since this research involved the human subject and collecting data from their feedback, and despite the fact that we still needed to be granted approval from the IRB, we had both the finished prerequisite survey and the process for conducting the evaluation ready to be implemented. Although we did not get the IRB approval, excluding the data we have yet to collect from participants, we did come across a lot of research from various sources. We discovered that the lack of on-campus exercise options at Gallaudet University, such as the limited schedule time (Gallaudet Athletics Weight Room 2022) and low, convenient commute between the fitness center and dorm, has resulted in a decrease in the number of people working out and has created an environment that discourages people from working out. Another result we discussed in our group was a member as a soccer player at Gallaudet University with other athletic teams: Charles experienced that the given workout plan and lessons provided by the coach were written on the whiteboard, which was ineffective for working out individually and with other athletic members. We also discovered that having a mobile device with a fitness app can significantly motivate and will gradually improve students’ mental and physical health (Wharton et al,. 2008), but the majority of apps don’t use exercises according to ACSM guidelines, which is likely to have an impact on the user’s health and results in inefficient workouts of low quality (Guo et al., 2022).</p><p>We have created the preliminary design via Adobe XD for the mobile application. Figure 5 shows the login page to verify the user’s identity and the home page, along with all of its essential features. Please note that this is not the final stage; further development with fresh concepts and features is worthwhile. The majority of the problems we currently have been solved by the mobile app.. It also complies with the prevalent use of fitness apps in the deaf community and increases the effectiveness of exercise with ACSM guidelines.</p><p><img src="/images/stm403,figure5.png" title="Figure 5: The Current Progress of Bison Fitness’ Login/Home Page Interface"></p><p>Our application prototype is finished and available for full interaction. This link <a href="https://xd.adobe.com/view/2f363568-09f5-4109-b326-a4765c4e20fc-7a65/">(Click here)</a> will take you to a demonstration of the application. When the Adobe XD prototype is opened, the viewer can use a mouse or trackpad to interact with the application’s buttons, much like on a real smartphone. Suppose the prototype receives clicks on areas that are not intended for clicking. In that case, blue boxes will appear on those that provide instructions to the viewer if they need clarification about how to interact with the prototype.</p><h3 id="Discussion-Conclusion"><a href="#Discussion-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Discussion/Conclusion"></a>Discussion/Conclusion</h3><p>In conclusion, the use of a fitness mobile application with ACSM guidelines and regular exercise with detailed instructions and video tutorials, combined with the support of a sign language interpreter, can bring numerous benefits to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Exercise can improve physical health by increasing cardiovascular endurance, strengthening muscles, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases. Additionally, regular exercise has been shown to improve mental health by reducing stress and anxiety, improving mood, and increasing self-esteem. A mobile fitness application, when used with the support of a sign language interpreter, can provide deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals with access to important health and fitness information, allowing them to track and monitor their physical activity, including different workout plans that can be set by an athletics coach or by the individual, and receive personalized workout recommendations. Overall, using a fitness mobile application and regular exercise, with the support of a sign language interpreter, can improve physical and mental health for deaf or hard-of-hearing individuals, making it an important aspect of their overall well-being.</p><h3 id="Future-Work"><a href="#Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h3><p>A further step in the evaluation and analysis of the data is needed, even if we get approval from the IRB approval which only covered a small portion of the data we had collected. So a survey with more varied questions with more participants is necessary to collect more details about fitness.</p><p>We encourage participants and other volunteer individuals who are fluent in ASL or another sign language to create instructional workout videos that we can later embed their video in our mobile app to make the app more diverse and support more sign language in the deaf community. We will also develop and implement the goal we set for ourselves, which includes incorporating the ACSM guideline, information on physical activity and nutrition, and the possibility of adding new ideas in the future.</p><p>We strongly encourage anyone interested and the Gallaudet student life skill department in our project during the spring semester of 2023, when it will be carried out in conjunction with the IT Senior Capstone course. Our members who majored in IT will develop the programmed mobile application with Swift, which will require a significant amount of fitness data and references.</p><h3 id="Roles"><a href="#Roles" class="headerlink" title="Roles"></a>Roles</h3><p>Abraham Cervantes: I will support and assist any group members who need it. Prepare the tool that will be used to collect data on the arriving participants, such as using Google Sheet to produce graphs or tools to build tables. On the mobile application, create a data diagram, chart, and graphic concept that contains statistical information for the user. It visually balances time and speed in terms of kilometers traveled. My experience at Gallaudet University improved, and I was able to provide for Bison Fitness by contributing to our project group.</p><p>Charles Harris: My duties included researching American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for physical activities and mental well-being and making some examples of ACSM guidelines in the presentation. Gathered more information from good sources with peer-reviewed on how to exercise app beneficial to physical health and mental health. Created the questionnaire survey about 24/7 fitness, our mobile app, then made visionary data (Unfortunately, we have yet to hear from IRB for approval that we could not get data). I also made a presentation with design and helped some with the final paper.</p><p>Zehui Liu: It is my responsibility to come up with the idea for the mobile app as well as any new concepts, draw them all into some flowcharts to make them more visualized, and then hand them over to Obaidullah so that he can design the application. In addition to this, it is my responsibility to work on and revise the draft of the project proposal as well as write the final paper.</p><p>Obaidullah Bakali: In this project, as I am majoring in Information Technology, I am responsible for the technological aspect. I also am responsible for scheduling in-person or Zoom meetings to ensure that we all work together on the same page. I researched and reviewed several mobile designs for this project to improve the UI design. Since I have the Adobe XD prototype on my laptop, I am mainly focused on designing the mobile app and getting input from the three members of my group. In the project pitch, I helped organize concepts to include. In this proposal, I typed the issues section while we were discussing it in the group meeting and added some to the methods and results section.</p><h3 id="References"><a href="#References" class="headerlink" title="References"></a>References</h3><table>    <tr>        <td>Chin, J.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>13.1 Compare WCAG 3.0 with WCAG 2.1 (C?)</li><li>13.2 Describe future possibilities of web accessibility standards (C?)</li></ul><p>The accessibility standard that is in effect right now is WCAG2.1. In addition, the WCAG2.2 will receive its final update some time before end of the year 2022. Accessibility for all disabled people is also required to catch up with the rapid advancement of technology in order to guarantee that all users will have full access to the internet’s vast resources. As a result, the members who work for the WCAG are currently developing the new standard known as WCAG 3.0. It was stated in one of the articles that the publication wouldn’t be considered official until 2023. The WCAG3.0 document is still in the stage of being a working draft, and additional new ideas or some functions still need to be revised and some changes made to them. The draft is available to be viewed online.</p><p>The newly developed standard will incorporate some features that are new, in addition to those that have been carried over from WCAG2.1. However, due to the fact that the standard changes from A, AA, and AAA to the number score. It is the number that ranges from the lowest possible score to the highest possible score on the standard, and its purpose is to provide a better description of how important and necessary it is to measure accessibility. It is more flexible, which allowed users and developers to have a better understanding of how to use the accessibility standard, and it also improved the accessibility of the product. Nevertheless, this is not the final decision, and the members are still discussing about it.</p><p>The readability will undergo significant revisions as a result of the fact that fully comprehending the WCAG2.x standard is not an easy task. Therefore, the members are considering to add the simplified symbols and letters, with a natural sense to ensure that those who are reading the WCAG for the first time can quickly understand what they are reading. It is possible to eliminate some superfluous contexts and reconstruct the category class, among other things.</p><p>The standard has also been made stricter, such that if one fatal had been made, even if it’s just one fatal mistake, the corresponding standard will drop down to a score of zero, and it will be marked as inaccessible.</p><p>In summary, it will be a great updated and improvement version of the WCAG standard for people who are disabled, with more features being added, as well as a revision of some of the unnecessary standards from the previous version of WCAG and the older version. Therefore, with this standard improvement, we should also spread the standard, ensure that almost all websites have sufficient accessibility, and enhance the browsing experience for people with disabilities.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>12.1 Identify corporate approaches to implementing web accessibility (C?)</li><li>12.2 Describe the challenges for implementing web accessibility (C?)</li></ul><p>The majority of nations have enacted legislation that safeguard the civil rights of disabled people in homes, parks, businesses, and educational institutions. Access to websites and applications hosted on the internet is not universal. But for now It had been done for a long time ago by the federal and government department where involved with lots of disabled employees and more diversity of disabled employees, the accessibility has been adding more over the course of the last two decades. However, certain rules, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 508, do not apply to the internet services in question, which include video streaming as well as social media websites and applications. These apps and web were supposed to be an efficient means of communication, making it possible for all of the information to be made available to everyone. However, these businesses have a tendency to block off those people who have disabilities since they believe there are only a small number of them, and because the world is still dominated by people who can hear, this does not have a significant impact on many things. These businesses simply concentrate on any kind of features they may add and hope to attract more customers who are hearing</p><p>One example of a private company that was brought up during our conversation is Twitter, whose management recently passed to Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturing company. The recent events, such as firing off those individuals who worked in Twitter when it had over 7,000 employees and now has only a few hundreds of employees, are highly regrettable and unacceptable. Elon Musk’s actions had a significant impact on a variety of departments, most notably the accessibility engineering team, which had been laid off. This team was responsible for helping to make the website usable for people with disabilities, particularly those who struggle with sensory challenges, mobility issues, and visual or auditory impairment. It is a sign that Twitter may stop providing its users with access to the newest and most cutting-edge features in the future.</p><p>Therefore, one approach that may be taken is to consider how to persuade them or inform everyone else that the accessibility of websites and apps is a requirement that must be met in order to add features at all times. One potential obstacle is the amount of time. The corporation will need to carry out a number of different tests on the product and use the services of a few specialists. After that, the group will proceed to follow the evaluation to determine what issues are present with the product and make more tweaks and adjustments.</p><p>The fact that the company always has a restricted budget for the product means that it must eliminate elements that aren’t really necessary in order to concentrate on the aspects that are essential. Another problem is the money. A potential option in which businesses might receive financial support from the government, allowing those businesses to implement and expand the majority of accessibility features.</p>]]></content>

It is also applicable to the Congress of the United States.<br>To be eligible for protection under the ADA, a person must either themselves have a disability or maintain a relationship or association with another person who does. According to the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), a person is considered to have a disability if they either have a physical or mental impairment that significantly inhibits one or more of the major life activities, if they have a history or record of having such an impairment, or if they are perceived by other people to have such an impairment. However, The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) does not identify each and every impairment that it protects.</p><h3 id="Telecommunication-Act"><a href="#Telecommunication-Act" class="headerlink" title="Telecommunication Act"></a>Telecommunication Act</h3><p>Manufacturers of telecommunications equipment and providers of telecommunications services are required, according to Section 255 and Section 251(a)(2) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to ensure that such equipment and services are accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, if it is readily achievable to do so. These provisions were added to the Communications Act in 1996. Because of these amendments, people who have disabilities will be able to access a wide variety of products and services, such as telephones, cell phones, pagers, call-waiting, and operator services, which were previously inaccessible to a large number of users with disabilities.</p><h3 id="Rehabilitation-Act-Section-508"><a href="#Rehabilitation-Act-Section-508" class="headerlink" title="Rehabilitation Act; Section 508"></a>Rehabilitation Act; Section 508</h3><p>The requirements that are outlined in Section 508 apply to any and all forms of electronic and information technology that are created, maintained, purchased, or used by the federal government. People with disabilities, including federal employees and members of the general public, are required to have access to all electronic and information technology used by the federal government in accordance with Section 508.<br>An accessible information technology system is one that does not rely on the user’s singular sense or ability in any way and can be operated in a variety of different ways by the user. For instance, people who have visual impairments may not be able to use a system that only provides output in the form of images, and people who are deaf or hard of hearing may not be able to use a system that only provides output in the form of sounds if the system only provides output in the form of sounds. It’s possible that some people with disabilities will require accessibility-related software or peripheral devices in order to use computer systems that are in compliance with Section 508.</p><p>Since each state is responsible for the enforcement of its own laws, it would appear that the federal laws do not apply to the states. It is possible that some of the accessibility measures taken by states are inadequate, and as a result, they are inaccessible.<br>And vice versa, certain states had very detailed information that explained which part of the disabilities should be applicable in a variety of different possible situations. One such example is the law 18VAC135-50-200 of the state of Virginia. Prohibitions against discrimination on the basis of disability at the general level.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>10.1 Describe the history of WAI-ARIA development (C?)</li><li>10.2 Implement a working WAI-ARIA (C?)</li></ul><p>For digital accessibility, the screen reader technology includes a variety of different pieces of equipment, such as braille writers, scanning equipment, and other screen readers. I will browse the website using the keyboard and act as though I am blind so that I can use the screen reader to test the website’s digital accessibility: web accessibility auditing showcase.<br>After installing and setting up the extension and the integrated function screen reader that comes with the Edge browser, and then I will use the keyboard to interact with the content that is displayed on the webpage. In addition to that, I had tried out a few of the things, such as the PDF and the image gallery. The Read aloud option of the Edge browser allows for text on the screen to be read out loud. Due to the fact that I am hard of hearing and use a cochlear implant, the speaking is not always very clear to me. As a result, I had to use the voice to text recognition apps on my phone in order to have a more positive experience when using the screen reader.<br>And I had try all of the content in the website:</p><ul><li>Left side menu: It is first not obvious to me since the left side menu is supposed to be the last part of the webpage, but it appears to give me the impression that the left side menu is the first portion of the webpage. However, I do not object to it and do not find it objectionable in any way.</li><li>Carousel at the top of the content area of the page: It performs a good job of displaying the text and provides a concise explanation of each image, which allows me to imagine what the image would seem like to someone who is blind.</li><li>Accordion on the right: excellent and user-friendly in directing me through each drop-down menu and allowing me to read the contents.</li><li>Tab panel in the centre of the page: In the poor example, the tab does not make sense to me, whereas in the excellent example, it functions perfectly, and I have no trouble understanding any of the content.</li></ul><p>Landmarks present on the page(list them): <mark class="hl-label blue">h1</mark>  such as web accessibility auditing showcase, Home, <mark class="hl-label blue">h2</mark>  like bad example, and good example and useful resources. The html code for each page contained headings labeled “h1,” “h2,” “h3,” and so on. Because of this, whenever there is text on a page that does not particularly interest me, I can just skip the “h2” and “h3” headings and go straight to the “h1” heading for the next section of the page.</p><p>During this activity, I only spent ten minutes exploring the homepage of the web accessibility auditing showcase website. I spent an additional five minutes trying to learn and get the hang of using the screen reader with a number of different keyboard input functions; however, I am now able to use the screen reader to access the most fundamental input functions.</p><p>And I think it is a little bit inefficient for both me and also for blind people, because it seems impossible to let blind users see and know all of the content in a very short amount of time; it is a little bit inefficient for blind people. so I think people should work on improving that aspect of it. The screen reader application itself is quite useful, however more developers need to be made aware that ARIA compliance is essential for all websites.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>9.1 Identify the aspects of a screenreader (C?)</li><li>9.2 Evaluate a website using a screenreader (C?)</li></ul><p>The primary objective of the screen reader is to deliver as many messages as possible to the user. This objective applies regardless of the user’s ability level; typical users as well as those with disabilities are able to use the screen reader at any given time and in any given circumstance. And the vast majority of people who use the screen reader are either blind, low-vision, or both blind and low-vision users. It gives the feedback, and the information that is being read is being supplied under the control of the user.</p><p>The Text-to-Speech (TTS) function is one that may be used, and it can convert the information that is displayed on the screen into speech, which can be played through headphones or speakers. The TTS reader may take the form of a software program that is bundled together with the screen reader, or it may take the form of a hardware device that is plugged into the computer. It is also possible to offer information in Braille; however, in order to do so, an additional hardware device known as a refreshable Braille display is necessary, and this will necessitate the use of that device. There can be anywhere from one to several rows of cells in a refreshable Braille display. Each cell has the potential to take the form of a Braille character, which is made up of a succession of dots arranged in a pattern that is analogous to that of domino dots.</p><p>The Braille characters on the display will update to reflect the new information as it appears on the computer screen. This will provide users with up-to-date information that comes directly from the computer. While it is feasible to use each format on its own, most people prefer to use PDFs. Speech output and braille output are two forms of output that are frequently used together.</p><p>The popular operating systems, including those found on personal computers and mobile phones, are compatible with screen readers:</p><ul><li>Windows: Window Eyes</li><li>Apple(iOS and MacOS): Voice Over</li><li>Android: TalkBack</li></ul><p>These are the applications that come pre-installed on the computer and can be used by the user without the need to install anything else. The user may also use third-party software such as Jaws for Windows, but this is entirely up to their discretion.</p><p>I’m going to test out a website called Google Drive by using the screen reader that comes installed on my iPhone, which is called VoiceOver. Once I’m logged in, I’ll use the screen reader to go through some folders and files. After spending around half an hour to studying and familiarizing myself with VoiceOver and its various features, I have the following results:</p><ul><li>I was able to successfully log in to my Google Drive account, which required me to enter my email address and password. This step took me around five minutes, during which time I had to type each letter or number individually. Which is not very comfortable for me to use, and it is highly ineffective, but I believe that users with low eyesight or no vision at all require this.</li><li>After I have logged into my Google Drive account, the user interface can be confusing at times because I tend to read from the top left to the bottom right. However, the design of the interface is intended for users with normal vision, which makes it difficult for blind users to use. Additionally, the interface contains a lot of complicated information, which blind users are unable to remember in a short amount of time, which requires them to go back and read it again.</li></ul>]]></content>

But it does not effective enough. Because there is a huge amount of accessibility that needs to be tested, and because working on it necessitates a significant amount of time. So that we may use the tool, an excellent example of which is a tool called AXE accessibility DevTools. This tool is based on the WCAG, and it can assist us in determining which component of the website is not accessible. A programmable plugin like this one can be installed in the browser. Given that it is intended for the developer, they will need to manually enable it after going into the web developer page and doing so. Only then will the accessibility be checked. It is a really simple procedure, and all you need is a little bit of time to become acquainted with the information that they include.</p><p>It had helped a lot of institutions achieve the digital accessibility goals, such as retailers, airlines, hotel chains, and the government. It is free to use for the individual, but with limitation functions; therefore, it provides the Axe DevTools Pro and Enterprise version, which includes details about the accessibility with higher standards.</p><p>Following the completion of the website evaluation, we will need to provide a summary of what we discovered while analyzing the targeted website and explain the problem. A specialized report is born, and it is created by the specialist that is knowledgeable on accessibility, and they will analyze the websites that are the focus of their investigation and evaluate them. Find out some of the problems that exist, and then write a report about their experience using the internet, including an evaluation report, the criteria, a conclusion, and a recommendation.<br>After delivering the report to the developer, the accessibility specialist might be required to collaborate with the developer in order to determine what the most fundamental and fundamentally important accessibility standards are. This would come after the specialist had already given the developer the report. The professional will act as a consultant to advise them on how to make improvements to the website in question.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>7.1 Describe the types of assistive technology (C?)</li><li>7.2 Describe the process of testing for accessibility (C?)</li></ul><p>Assistive technology is a broad term that can refer to a variety of different things. For example, it can refer to mobility devices like walkers and wheelchairs that enable people with disabilities to be able to do something by using the mobility device. It can also refer to certain pieces of hardware and software that help people with disabilities access computers and other information technologies such as accessibility for website, the software had integrated functions that allow user to set up their accessible preference. In this week, we were discussed and concentrated on the assistive technology for reading pdf files and how it can be used and set up for those who require accessibility in order to read pdf information.</p><p>There are many different kinds of assistive technology that can be used on pdf file. One of the most common features is magnifiers, which enable the user to make the texts and images larger for those who have limited vision. Screen reading functions allow a computer to “speak out” for blind users by reading information and words one at a time. It may be difficult for some people to use all of the information contained within a PDF due to the complicated layouts that may be included in some PDFs. Therefore, the significance of content ordering is the primary worry, and it is necessary to add more tags and a number order in order to concentrate on a certain piece of content at one time only. It is required that images of alternative text also be included, and if it is necessary, the decorating images should be removed and there are many more functions that may be used, depending on what situation is needed.</p><!-- ![](/images/ITS395/inaccessible_pdf.jpg "Inaccessiable Image-Based PDF") --><img src="/images/ITS395/inaccessible_pdf.jpg" class="" width="480" height="521" title="Inaccessiable Image-Based PDF"><p>The accessibility testing by an expert or anyone who had the capacity knowledge of accessibility is the necessary step that needs to be done in order to ensure that the fundamental functionalities will be available for use in pdf format.</p><p>These experts will be of assistance and will determine whether or not the PDF is accessible by the majority of users. This week in class, Our professor demonstrated how to utilize a piece of software called Adobe Acrobat DC. One of the built-in features that made it possible for the pdf editor to update and adjust the accessibility of the document. In addition to that, it had the capabilities to test the PDF to see if it met the requirements for basic usability.</p><!-- ![](/images/ITS395/AccReport.jpg "Adobe Acrobat PDF Accessibility Test Report") --><img src="/images/ITS395/AccReport.jpg" class="" width="797" height="954" title="Adobe Acrobat PDF Accessibility Test Report">]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>6.1 Describe the features of an accessible website (C?)</li><li>6.2 Describe how the web browser supports web accessibility (C?)</li></ul><p>It is contingent on the website itself wanting what kind of accessibility, the WCAG2.1 showed numerous accessibility elements and allowed developers to design following them, but the type of accessibility desired is dependent on the website itself. However, it appears unfeasible to allow every website to have the same accessibility characteristics as those stated in WCAG2.1. Therefore, some of the content on the website needs to contain the basic elements of use for persons with disabilities, whether those disabilities involve the senses, the mind, or the body.</p><p>It is a standard procedure, and it is also one of the easiest methods, to provide alternative text for individuals who are visually impaired. Some of the images that are used for decoration on the website may be excluded by hiding them using CSS code. Since these images are only used for decoration, removing them will result in a slight shift in the visual presentation, but the text content itself will not change. CSS can use it as:</p><figure class="highlight css"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="selector-class">.classname</span>&#123;<span class="attribute">display</span>:none;&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>The name that is assigned from an HTML text is called <mark class="hl-label blue">.classname</mark> , and it can be used to name any photos or material.</p><mark class="hl-label blue">display:none</mark>  is used to hide the image in the browser; however, the content itself continues to exist and is saved in the HTML and CSS file. This material can be revealed at any moment by changing the layout's none property to either <mark class="hl-label blue">block</mark> , <mark class="hl-label blue">inline</mark> .<p>the following additional essential images are required to accompany the alt text:</p><figure class="highlight html"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre><span class="line">1</span><br></pre></td><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="tag">&lt;<span class="name">img</span> <span class="attr">src</span>=<span class="string">&quot;presentation.jpg&quot;</span> <span class="attr">alt</span>=<span class="string">&quot; A google slide has the topic named Presentation written in the middle of the slide and an author&#x27;s name John Doe in the bottom left corner of the slide.&quot;</span>&gt;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure><p>This needs to be very particular and describe as much as is reasonably possible, and then convert those pictures into plain words to describe the vivid picture as best as possible without adding a lot of extra characters or effort.</p><p>Users who are colorblind have a requirement for the addition of high contrast and color; browser extensions provide the tools necessary to force the website backdrop or any sensitive color to the color that works best for you. Alternately, we can achieve it by adjusting the colors as necessary through the use of CSS. PSA offered developers with visual examples of what doing this for colorblind people looks like and also include the WCAG2.1 result so that developers can determine whether or not a photo or image is suitable for colorblind users.</p><p>Adjusting the font size and ensuring that the layout is well-fitted in the browser on both the computer and the mobile phone are also important for those individuals who have difficulty reading. These individuals find it difficult to keep track of what the content is about, and they require being in a concise place in order to follow the follow of the content because there is a lack of whitespace and clear linear pathways. To remedy this problem, we should steer clear of any repetitive or redundant texts and decorations as well as slash line reading text and information. Additionally, we should strive to be more straightforward, and we should alter the font text size appropriately.</p>]]></content>

The accessibility features that we require to create it uniquely for each individual or to optimize its features. To determine which accessibility option is optimal for them. We must comprehend the nature of their infirmities.<br>Motor Disability refers to any disorder that hinders sensation, movement, or coordination. These disabilities can originate from a variety of causes, including congenital diseases, illnesses, and physical trauma, but they typically present similar obstacles to web browsing.</p><p>Possible well-fitted accessibility for physical injuries and impairments:</p><ul><li>Cerebral palsy is a damage to the brain that causes a loss of muscle control.</li><li>Muscular dystrophy is a hereditary condition that affects the genes that regulate the creation of muscle protein.</li><li>Back Spine, partly congenital disorder in which the spine fails to fully wrap around the spinal cord during the first trimester of pregnancy, resulting in some loss of physical movement.</li></ul><p>Some assistive devices can give an acceptable or above-average level of accessibility. Head wands and mouth sticks, which go over the head or into the mouth and extend toward a control interface, are a common form of assistive technology.</p><p>The user can manage an adaptive computer mouse, keyboard, or other assistive equipment by manipulating a wand or stick with their neck and jaw muscles. Additionally, there is the adaptable keyboard. Word-completion technology and elevated spaces between keys that allow users to rest their hands in position when not typing or during muscle spasms may be included. Those with minimal or no hand control may benefit from eye-tracking gadgets, which allow them to use eye movement to navigate the web. Different forms of accessibility tools are evolving and being applied to everyone; what we need to do is give them with a better web-using experience, possibly extending to other areas of use.</p><p>Cognitive problems typically have a negative impact on the way information is processed. A wide variety of aspects, such as people’s perceptions, memories, languages, attention, ability to solve problems, and comprehension levels. People will be able to have a better experience and more opportunities to connect with content. Additionally, they will be able to process information in ways that are more useful to them thanks to the technology. In order to provide those who have cognitive or learning disabilities with the best possible user experience, it is a good idea, for instance, to direct them to simplified web material that provides them with the option to access information in both text and audio form.</p><p>People need to get started working on this area of study in order to find a solution to the significant problem of limited accessibility of mental health user services. The majority of the research and study is focused on how to improve the online content so that people who use it for mental health purposes can locate resources on the site that will help them relieve their stress and anxiety. Nonetheless, there is a certain aspect of access such as the special features only designed to mental health user is still not applicable to be use.</p><p>A user is said to have non-literacy or illiteracy if they are incapable of reading and comprehending the intricate or profound meaning of the language they use. The simple text, accompanied by graphics that help to visualize it, or a brief movie that contains as little words as possible but yet conveys the information effectively may be one way to help them grasp it better.</p><p>People of a greater age certainly experienced a loss of body function, which may also entail a loss of physical function. Do provide the accessibility, such as simple interaction with the website, alternatives for increasing the text size with only the click of a button, and the ability to alert them with a larger feedback reflection.</p><p>Users with a high sensitivity to motion risk experiencing discomfort or even physical injury from interactions with moving objects. So in order to accommodate motion-sensitive users, both CSS and iOS 7 have included a function that allows users to turn off unwanted motion.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>Describe vision-related challenges in web accessibility that users face.</li><li>Identify web accessibility tools or approaches that benefit users with vision challenges.</li><li>Analyze the effectiveness of WCAG 2.1 in measuring accessibility for blind users.</li></ul><p>According to the statistics, around 285 million people worldwide are visually impaired. 39 million individuals are blind, while 246 million have impaired eyesight. There are numerous types of visually impaired individuals for whom it is important to provide easier online access or browsing. WCAG2.1 has introduced a requirement for individuals with low vision, describing what individuals with low vision require for electronic information, tools, and technology to be accessible. Includes an overview of low vision and a description of specific user requirements. Therefore, it is in excellent condition for blind users.</p><p>The WCAG2.1 specified multiple levels, including hardware, operating system, user agents, extensions, and plug-ins. They had to add as many things as possible to ensure that blind individuals could access everything. The following are concerns that I believe blind users are now having and that need to be resolved immediately:<br>HTML structure: the majority of famous websites now provide basic and advanced accessibility for people with disabilities. One feature that can be used is the screen reader, which can detect and read the CSS of a page, but this feature will need to be added and supported on third-party websites. Others relied on unstyled HTML, which causes problems when the screen reader determines what should be read first on a page. To overcome this problem, all HTML should be formatted similarly to a printed page, such that it makes sense when read from left to right, top to bottom. The routine update from the developer must include these changes for the screen reader to function properly.</p><p>The lack of color contrast between text and backgrounds is one of the most common accessibility issues. Color contrast is a fundamental component of online accessibility since it aids users in perceiving page information. WCAG 2 defines contrast as the difference in luminance between two colors. Persons with limited contrast sensitivity, such as the elderly, or colorblind people may not be able to distinguish between text and backdrop of specific colors with a low contrast ratio. Popular browsers include built-in functions that allow the user to force a certain hue to the desired intensity level.</p><p>People with visual impairments frequently find it difficult or impossible to use a mouse to surf a website; thus, they navigate using the keyboard. Those with visual impairments can navigate a website using keyboard shortcuts and commands. A website must have well-structured content with proper header structures and be coded to permit keyboard access to all information and functionality, including hyperlinks, links, forms, and media controls. Users would utilize the Tab key to navigate the page, and while they do so, there must be a visual keyboard focus indicator indicating the element they are on. Essential functions that must be provided on every website.</p><p>There are still a great number of potential approaches that could lead blind users to browse sites that are inaccessible or that do not provide sufficient accessibility. This has to be done with a large number of volunteers and experiments for blind people in order to make things more accessible for them.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>Describe web accessibility challenges that deaf users face.</li><li>Identify web accessibility tools and approaches that benefit deaf users.</li></ul><p>To understand what challenges deaf people faced, we must first understand what deaf is and why they are deaf, how they need accessibility due to their deaf disability, and where we can apply those accessibility on deaf users in a proper situation, such as in person accessibility or virtual online accessibility.</p><p>Deaf is an adjective word used to describe someone who lacks the ability to hear or has impaired hearing, according to the dictionary. It is a physical condition in which the person is unable to collect information through their ears. Deafness can be caused by a variety of factors, including aging hearing loss, genetic factors when they were born, or a specific medicine that led them to become deaf. So, accessibility is to guide or provide an easy route for them to rapidly comprehend what they need and how people may help them.</p><p>Accessibility is not exclusively for the deaf; it is a subset of accessibility for deaf users; there are many more ways to assist persons with disabilities. So, this sort of accessibility sometimes necessitates a certain amount of money to develop into a perfect form for deaf users to acquire what information they want on specific situations. However, the information they get is still slower than that of hearing people since it takes more time, more equipment, more technology to obtain, whereas hearing people can simply communicate to one other. It is also critical to design the computer’s interface with humans, which is the designer’s primary focus to lead the deaf user to use the accessibility function on website. Some low quality audio, lack in interpretation for text, audio and video and limited customer support options such as telephone for contacting the bank agent to process order and more are all the fatal problem on deaf. Some poor design website do not have enough of budget to develop those functions caused the deaf user were unable to access.</p><p>The bulk of accessibility functions, as well as a highly popular tool, are captions, which enable the transcription or translation of spoken language in streaming or another live video. It is popular because it may nearly always apply to everyone: hearing, hard of hearing, and hearing loss. They can be beneficial to everyone. Hearing people may be able to read the captions if they hear something but are unsure what it is, or if they missed parts of the speaking. For those who are deaf or hard of hearing could be able to read the captions to understand what it is speaking.</p><p>Another popular feature is live chat, which is a tiny window on the left or right side of the website that allows consumers to contact agents without having to call them. This sort of feature is also very useful for deaf users. As a result, deaf users are more likely to use text-based communication as a secondary compromise technique, whereas ASL is more likely to be used as their first language. The plain English with short sentences is essential, as is staying on point and avoiding jargon or rarely used English work. If required, a graphic to illustrate the topic or anything is also a terrific idea that would aid deaf users greatly.</p><p>There are also more features that may be implemented, such as ASL video for visual interpretation; but, in order to give the proper message, a very skilled certificated interpreter is required. A transcript, which comes with a page or more of text with everything they’ve spoken on it, is also an option. These things must be adaptable and organize in order to navigate the information they get.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>2.1 Describe the history of WCAG</li><li>2.2 Identify any criticism of WCAG</li></ul><p>The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 1.0 were published in May 1999. WCAG 1.0 was a first step in defining criteria for web accessibility, focusing mostly on HTML. This iteration of the WCAG featured the compliance levels that we are still acquainted with today: A, AA, and AAA. Conformity to level A would entail complying with only level A success criteria, but conformance to level AAA would mean complying with every success criterion: A, AA, and AAA, making AAA the most thorough.</p><p>WCAG 2.0 was released over a decade later, in December 2008. WCAG 2.0 considered a wide range of technologies and advised developers to make all digital material accessible rather than just HTML-based content. In addition to accounting for a wider range of technologies, WCAG 2.0 developed four often referred to and used principles: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust. These rules serve as categories for the WCAG success criteria; each success criterion tackles a barrier or barriers to making material visible, operable, comprehensible, and/or resilient for all users.</p><p>Another decade has passed, and WCAG 2.1 has been launched (June 2018). Instead of a major rewrite, as witnessed in the shift from 1.0 to 2.0, WCAG 2.1 adds success criteria to the existing 2.0 rules. This inclusion of new rules, rather than the rebuilding of existing rules, demonstrates the meticulous effort required to develop WCAG 2.0. Many of the new WCAG 2.1 criteria address accessibility restrictions that have become apparent as mobile web surfing has grown in popularity. Then, a working draft of WCAG 2.2 was just released in August 2020. The working draft WCAG 2.2, which is an extension of the existing standards, presently includes new success criteria and changes to one existing success criteria.</p><p>Because the technology we use is continually evolving, the criteria we use to analyze websites for accessibility must be updated to stay consistent. WCAG 2.1 and 2.2 cover weaknesses that have emerged since the introduction of WCAG 2.0 as the norm for online accessibility, but as we saw in the progression of WCAG from 1.0 to 2.0, a thorough rethink of these standards will eventually be required. To meet this requirement, a task group has been created to develop an altogether new set of online accessibility standards. The revised recommendations will be known as “W3C Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 3.0.” The World Wide Web Consortium, abbreviated W3C, is “an worldwide community that produces open standards to assure the long-term evolution of the web”. The inclusion of W3C in the official name is significant since it indicates that these criteria will eventually be applied to more than simply web content.</p><p>While the WCAG is improving with many updates and drafts, I must admit that it is a little complicated for me when designing a website or an application for end-users. The most essential aspect is that it is not mandatory; this may be one of the reasons why the WCAG is not widely used nowadays. If it is an act or a legislation that is carried out by the government or country, and it is mandatory and forced to have those accessible features and elements or you’ll get fine for not following the law. I am confident that it would be much greater than what we have now for providing various of accessibility to be able to use for many disabilities users.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ul><li>1.1 Describe the importance of web accessibility</li><li>1.2 Define different types of disability</li></ul><p>Week 1 Assignment<br>Web accessibility (also known as Digital Accessibility or Web usability) aims to ensure that anyone has the means to access the media content placed on the Web - regardless of whether people experience physical, mental, or technical barriers that prevent the information posted by the author. This means making content on the Web “accessible” and easy to access and use. Whether it is the general public or people with physical or mental disabilities, they need to have a standardized website to access information easily. Web accessibility is to expand the standardization of the website and to design the website with a more rigorous attitude and conditions so that the content of the website can be “accessible” to users with different levels or needs.</p><p>Web pages created using the Web Accessibility Guidelines, such as WCAG standards and W3C Accessibility Standards, are useful for users with visual, auditory, mobility, and cognitive impairments. It is also useful for users of older, slower computers. In fact, an approachable design is not only helpful for those who have difficulties in their daily lives but also for all others who would benefit from a better interface. The advantages of web accessibility also include increasing the diversity of employment opportunities, shortening the digital gap, expanding social life, relieving psychological stress, etc.</p><p>A developer who designs the website needs to have enough knowledge to be able to comprehend various types of disabilities in order to determine which accessibility is best for disability users. This is one of the most important things that we need to work on. One significant accessibility is the numerous websites that people can access without any problem, including those with hearing or vision impairments or any other disability that affects physical structure or function; accessibility is a general term that includes any impairment or restriction in activities. There could be a number of factors that contributed to the disability, including a person’s age, cognitive impairment from birth, various diseases, and accidents that affected the person with the disability. According to an article, the top 3 causes of disability are heart disease, back or spine issues, and arthritis or rheumatism. These are the ailments and diseases that affect us most frequently.</p><p>Many regions and governments have formed their disability standards available as a guide, listing nearly every type of disability that could possibly affect a person along with a thorough explanation of how to recognize it and the boundaries it places on them. Where people can offer accessible services to people with disabilities. As an example, the United States passed the Americans with Disabilities Act, which outlines the rights to which people with disabilities are entitled, including non-discrimination in employment. These laws/Acts also give them their rights to get what they should get. Additionally, the amendment clarifies what phrases like “major life act” and “substantial limitations” mean.</p><p>In conclusion, the primary objective of accessibility is to enable everyone to use the website, regardless of their language proficiency or type of disability. The website should be accessible to almost everyone. There are many different kinds of disabilities in the world and among us, so some may be difficult to identify while others may be obvious from a person’s physical actions. To learn more, consult a reference list of the various disabilities is a necessary step.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Closed Interpreting Accessibility</title>
      <link href="/2022/07/21/REU/finalPaper/"/>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Abstract"><a href="#Abstract" class="headerlink" title="Abstract"></a>Abstract</h3><p>Sign language in the media, either on-site or remotely (video interpreting) is provided to people who are Deaf and hard of hearing (DHH) to be informed about critical information (e.g. COVID-19 briefings) and other critical information in their daily lives. Access to Sign Language on TV or online media is not a requirement outlined within the American Disability Act. It is known that the DHH community relies primarily on closed captions as the most accessible option available on all media platforms. There is an increasing trend that sign language interpreting is provided exclusively in news outlets during COVID-19 lockdown (NAD vlogs, 2020) and it will continue to grow in the near future. To promote quality accessibility, we came up with a tool called AblePlayer, an accessible tool similar to closed captioning that will be displayed with an MP4 video that can be toggled on and off. The closed interpreting tool is user-adjustable. It contains settings such as: interpreter size, transparency, and location. All of which can be adjusted by the user. This study aims to evaluate and understand the current practice of media in the US and abroad. We want to eliminate all the barriers of closed captions (CC), picture in picture (PIP), and live interpreting. We hypothesize that having closed interpreting would affect the Deaf viewer’s comprehension positively. We collected feedback from 10 deaf, hearing, and hard of hearing sign language users through observational study, followed by an end-user survey. The addition of captions had a favorable effect on the participants’ comprehension rate. The most noticeable variations in understanding between viewing a sign language interpreter with no background color preference, as well as the draggable window and resize features, garnered good responses from a majority of our participants. The findings led to recommendations for the uniform usage of certified sign interpreters with no background color, draggable windows, and resize options in subtitles video across multiple media platforms.</p><h3 id="Introduction"><a href="#Introduction" class="headerlink" title="Introduction"></a>Introduction</h3><p>The utilization of sign language interpreter videos has grown as a result of the fast development of high-speed data transmission and video compression technology. Deaf and hard of hearing people are increasingly adapting to acquire information from television shows, films, and websites. Thus, sign language interpreter films are intended for the deaf and hard of hearing who rely on sign language as a valuable tool for translating spoken and/or written words. Despite the fact that little study has been conducted on how deaf individuals perceive a recording of a sign language interpreter when watching web films, several issues are clear.</p><p>Accessibility is ‘ad-hoc’ with traditional picture in picture sign language on TV because the media tends to crop out the screen of the interpreter if it is even available to all, which prevents the sign language viewer from getting full access to information. Providing PIP on a few channels or sources achieves critical mass, albeit with limited success. If not properly set up, it might be difficult for the signing audience to see what is being spoken, resulting in incomplete communication. It only caters to the DHH community on a limited level, therefore this issue may be difficult for DHH individuals because the media is hearing-centric, and they have little experience with sign language translating on TV.<br>Captions are an alternative option to replace aural information that many deaf viewers find difficult to follow because the speed of verbatim captioning is likely to exceed their reading abilities. Even after controlling for reading level, deaf students learned less from on-screen text than hearing peers, apparently based on differences in background knowledge and information processing strategies. They prefer ASL interpreters over closed captions, partially because they find captions difficult to understand and partly because they receive less information. There are still concerns with video interpreters that must be solved.</p><p>We have outlined a few of the proposed study’s objectives. Our initial goal is to understand and learn what features help deaf, hard of hearing, and hearing sign language users. Next, we will examine how closed interpreting will assist society in including these accessibility features in mainstream accessibility standards such as closed captions. Following preliminary research, we aim to evaluate and analyze the collected data to determine how the complexity of supportive accessibility can be applied to general users, both signers and non-signers. Then we will determine which accessibility functions are the most helpful and desirable, as well as how we might improve the experience for a certain group of users.</p><h3 id="Research-Questions-Objectives"><a href="#Research-Questions-Objectives" class="headerlink" title="Research Questions/Objectives"></a>Research Questions/Objectives</h3><ul><li>In terms of design (preferred signer, signing style, background color) are these options enough for accessibility of the Deaf community?</li><li>What are the ‘new’ minimum features to be included?</li></ul><h3 id="Lit-Review-Background"><a href="#Lit-Review-Background" class="headerlink" title="Lit Review/Background"></a>Lit Review/Background</h3><p>This study aims to investigate the accessibility of media contents through sign language interpreting, which is still not widely adopted in the US. There have been several studies in the past few years (Yi, J. H. et al, 2020, Baliarda, M. B. et al. 2020, Debevc, M. et al. 2015) in Asia and Europe that have investigated the best practice of sign language interpreting in the media using PIP, and other customized features. The findings show that the PIP is essential to comprehending Sign Language users as their primary language. Additionally, those studies pursued further examination of the individual preference with the features such as sizing, placement, video backgrounds, etc). The current technology allows us to make this possible, but we do not know what the preferences are for DHH in the US. This study intends to duplicate other international studies from the DHH community to improve a better understanding of accessibility content so that DHH can conveniently access sign language in the media. The study will be designed to mainly focus on the group of participants whose primary language is American Sign Language (ASL). We call this research project ‘Closed Interpreting Accessibility’ (CIA.)</p><p>One study conducted in Korea, researched their Interpreting service among 30 Deaf and hard of hearing individuals over the age of 19. This study conducted a survey and had a selection of different types of interpreting services. Most users preferred the closed interpreting option (no background and reasonably sized). The worst screen clip out of all of the options are similar to what is currently shown on TV programs today (PIP). The experiment consisted of a total of three people: a subject, a sign language interpreter to help guide the experiment progress, and an investigator. Tobii Nano, an eye tracker, was attached to a 27-inch monitor to collect gaze information from the subject during the experiment. (Yi, J. H. et al 2020).</p><p>Another study researched how sign language users responded to a screen composition including a larger screen for the content and a smaller screen for the sign language interpreter. 32 deaf users participated in this experiment, watching four similar clips with four different screen compositions through focus group style research and surveys. The study registered the pattern of screen exploration with Eye Tracker, and assessed content recall with two questionnaires. Results show that sign language users mainly look at the sign language interpreter screen. This survey clarified the relevance of some parameters (type of on-screen insertion (picture-in-picture / half screen (split screen) / Chroma key); shot size (long shot / medium long shot / mid shot / medium close-up; interpreter’s clothing color (plain light color / plain dark color / patterned or multi- coloured); size of the interpreter’s screen (small / medium / large); on-screen positioning of the interpreter (right / left, top / center / bottom); position of the interpreter (standing / seated).) Others were considered irrelevant in terms of usability and quality of the SLI access service. For example, users considered gender, age, appearance and position of the interpreter to be of least importance. Whereas speed, size and color com- binations were the parameters that had a greater impact on screen legibility. The participants tend to look more often and for a longer time at the SLI side closer to the main screen. Results were interpreted in terms of perceptual strategies developed by Sign Language users. All participants considered that the most important on-screen parameter to grant accessibility was the size of the interpreter’s window. Most of them agreed that taking roughly a third of the split screen and using a medium shot or a medium-large shot would be ideal for news broadcasts. However, they acknowledged that it would not be appropriate for other television programs, such as interviews, films or documentaries where a larger scene screen was preferred (Baliarda, M. B. et al. 2020).</p><p>Finally, the main aim of a study conducted in Europe was to find out what the increment in comprehension of the content of sign language interpreter videos was, when captions were included. To be more specific, we compared the comprehension scores of sign language interpreter videos with or without captions. Additionally, we aimed to investigate the differences in comprehension scores between different topics (sport, hiking, shopping, and culture) presented in sign language interpreter videos with, or without, captions. Fifty-one deaf and hard of hearing sign language users alternately watched the sign language interpreter videos with, and without, captions. Afterwards, they answered ten questions. Participants were required to have the ability to read and actively understand basic written text and to have basic experience in using information and communication technology. The results showed that the presence of captions positively affected their rates of comprehension, which increased by 24% among deaf viewers and 42% among hard of hearing viewers. The results led to suggestions for the consistent use of captions in sign language interpreter videos in various media (Debevc, M. et al. 2015).</p><h3 id="Development-Setup"><a href="#Development-Setup" class="headerlink" title="Development/Setup"></a>Development/Setup</h3><p><em>Survey Setup:</em><br>We employed a screening survey at the early testing stage to qualify or exclude respondents, allowing us to ensure that respondents fit the criteria within our targeted participation group. To obtain valuable high-level responses, in-depth insights via an exit survey and interview at the end of the testing stage were conducted. This step is to obtain additional clarification information, answer participants’ confusing questions, and receive any feedback related to our research. The survey questions are based on the SUS (System Usability Scale), and participants will rank each question from 1 to 5 based on how much they agree with the statement they are reading. There are English and ASL versions available for use. Both surveys are done through Google form.</p><p><em>Able Player Setup:</em><br>We used Ableplayer as our priority supportive tool to implement the sign language interpreters and closed captions for all disability audiences. The original purpose of creating Ableplayer is to allow the front-end/full-stack developer to set up the accessible media player on the website, followed by WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guideline) accessibility checker. The contributor AccessComputing developed this professional development of the Ableplayer project at the University of Washington with financial support from NSF. Ableplayer is an open-source tool that anyone can use, modify, and add. We removed the redundant transcripts and chapter descriptions that are the built-in features in the original code source. We are mainly focused on the sign interpreters and closed captions only. Researcher Zehui Liu developed some new features that were more accessible by using JavaScript and jQuery during the methodology development stage. The current available of the following features can be used:<br>-The media controller’s essential functions included: a timeline bar, play/pause, rewind/forward, slow/fast speed.<br>-Built-in closed captions with user preferences provided, such as font size, text/background color, opacity, with newly added features: draggable captions in the media player.<br>-Added features of the drop-down menu to be allowed to select multiple interpreters with various background colors. Also, an alternative option of transparency from 0% to 100% is available to interact with.</p><p>The transparency option is not available all the time except the user enables interpreters features with no background. It is considered unintuitive for some users to interact with the transparency icons, but a tooltip will pop up when the user hovers that icon; it will provide a brief explanation of how to enable the transparency in some specific situation. Since this research is focused on the sign interpreters and closed captions, there is only minimum HCI of eight golden rules of the interface designed in Ableplayer.</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure1.png" title="Figure 1: Example of Two Sign Interpreters and Closed Captions on Able Player Media"></p><p>To provide the highest quality sample videos, the two Deaf ASL interpreters pictured above, are official certified interpreters on a professional level and are actively involved in Gallaudet University’s activities for the association of sign language interpreters. The purpose for having two interpreters of different skin tones served visual contrast purposes as the DHH community heavily relies on their vision to obtain information. The interpreters were filmed in front of a chroma key background at the Kellogg Hotel Lab to illuminate the interpreters in multiple positions from the waist up and lit by using four separate lighting positions while also controlling (or eliminating entirely) the shading and shadows produced by direct lighting. The videos were captured in the high-definition resolution of 3480 x 2160 at a 29.97fps camera. Due to the lack of support for the alpha channel (the interpreting video with no background only) in MP4 format, For each interpreter’s video, Ableplayer embeds an alternate format WebM in 1280x720 resolution with no background color. Nevertheless, the original video content itself is still in MP4 with 3480 x 2160 quality for optimal message delivery.</p><p>The interpreter window is designed with size placement and other customization options on Ableplayer in mind, along with a focus on the visibility of the sign language interpreter delivering the content. We chose essential information converting economic news, interviews, and visual graphic affairs. We aimed to include other forms of entertainment to simulate our daily basis of using accessibility to see if it is possible for all forms of media to be well fit for users. The order of videos was randomized to eliminate bias that can arise out of the order in which a participant sees stimuli. The sequence of the interpreters was likewise randomized; each video topic is designated with Interpreter A or Interpreter B as a video title.</p><p><em>Testing Room Setup:</em><br>Our participants tested the tool in a research lab at Gallaudet University. A 4K monitor is connected to a laptop where all equipment is already set up for participants. A camera to film the participants and their immediate reaction, thoughts, and feedback during the usability portion of the study. This process is coined as ‘Think Aloud Protocol’ (TAP). There is also screen recording to review which functions were clicked on the most and drew the most attention to. The researchers observed the participants and provided any help and support needed with technological problems and ASL clarification. Researchers made note not to impose help in effort to not tamper with the feedback given to us.</p><h3 id="Evaluation-Study"><a href="#Evaluation-Study" class="headerlink" title="Evaluation/Study"></a>Evaluation/Study</h3><ol><li>The investigator met the participant and explained the Informed Consent and Video Release form in ASL or spoken English. A general explanation of the study purpose was to be shared as follows: “At REU AICT, we are conducting studies of different people’s user experience and feedback on closed interpreting services to promote accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing community.”</li><li>The participants will sit in a room with a computer provided by Gallaudet along with a camera for recording feedback.</li><li>The research assistant will explain the process on how to perform the TAP during the study by providing a video example. Additionally, they will be expected to complete a survey of Net Promoter Scale (NPS) and System Usability Scale (SUS) questions.</li><li>Before starting the study, a video camera will start recording the participant’s immediate reaction as well as a screen recording of the desktop screen that the participant will be using. The participants will be directed to the Ableplayer webpage. During the process, the participant will have access to 4 videos of different media content and 2 different signers. The different tone of the skin for vision and contrast evaluation purposes. They will spend approximately 4-5 minutes on each video. Each window will have the same accessibility functions supplied and will be permitted to access each video.</li></ol><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure2.png" title="Figure 2: The  the Concept of the Participant Viewing the Able Player. "></p><p>The illustrated figure is an example of one video the participants watched and attempted to apply accessibility functions that they were most comfortable with and tested its effectiveness. There were a total of 4 videos, each video content was used from the public site platform YouTube. The footage was extracted and edited for length and uploaded in our private study webpage. Each video was played twice, once with one signer, next with the other. The participants will be asked to perform the Think Aloud Protocol (TAP) while using the platform. They are asked to describe their navigation, decision-making, and opinions during and throughout the process. The participants will fill out an end-user survey that entails a likert scale inspired by the System Usability Scale (SUS) and Net Promoter Score (NPS) followed by a short open-ended discussion.</p><p>Each participant was compensated for their time during the usability study with $25. All participants’ responses to both the usability study and survey remained confidential and was only to be shared among investigators and co-investigators of this study.</p><h3 id="Results"><a href="#Results" class="headerlink" title="Results"></a>Results</h3><p>Overall, feedback was mostly positive. There were mixed responses about the consistency and complexity of the tool. Results from the end user survey and recordings of the participants served to examine each of their reactions to each function, such as ease of use and how quickly they can manage each function. We employ surveys and open-ended discussions for feedback on user satisfaction, comprehension of video contents, and how simple it was to see each content video and interpreter videos.<br>Participants were asked to complete the questionnaire through Google Form immediately following each usability session. With a total of ten participants in our study, we used the same survey for each round of usability testing. We used an Excel chart generation tool to visualize each participant’s responses in order to evaluate and present the data. The SUS result of each participant was processed in accordance with the SUS calculations in Figure 3.1 and the scores for individual participants and different hearing status groups of participants were examined.</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure3.1.png" title="Figure 3.1: A Bar Chart of SUS Calculations by Score"></p><p>We gathered and documented each participant’s responses in order to create complete bar charts of SUS calculations. Combining these two dimensions produced a heat-map with positive and negative ratings, as illustrated in Figure 3.2.</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure3.2.png" title="Figure 3.2: Detailed Diagram of SUS Calculations by a Heatmap Matrix"></p><p>The formula we used to get the SUS score (Brooke and John, 2013) per participant begins by adding the total scores for all odd-numbered survey questions (highest number, 5, to mean positive feedback). Then subtract 5 from the total to get (X). For example in Participant B:</p><table>    <tr>        <td><div align="center"> <b>X=(4+4+4+3+5)-5</b></div></td>    </tr></table><p>Then we add up the total score for all even-numbered questions (lowest number, 1, to mean positive feedback) and subtract it from 25 to get (Y).</p><table>    <tr>        <td><div align="center"> <b>Y=25–(1+1+2+1+1)</b></div></td>    </tr></table><p>Finally, we multiply the total score of the new values (X+Y) by 2.5.</p><table>    <tr>        <td><div align="center"> <b><i>Participant B SUS score</i> = X+Y*2.5</b></div></td>    </tr></table><p>There is only one participant score computed above; When all of our (10) participants’ scores are aggregated, the average SUS score is 82.2, followed by the System Usability Acceptability Score, which is in the acceptable range but close to the excellent rating for good design. It is worth noting that all of the participants fully agree with the system and are quite confident in using it frequently. Both the SUS and System Usability Acceptability, received 49 points out of a possible 50 on survey questions 1 and 9, accounting for 98 percent of the highest rate in the study.</p><p>In the open-ended discussion portion of the study, the majority of the participants agreed with the statement that Ableplayer was a useful tool and can be applied to our real life on a daily basis on each media player. Only a small number of respondents indicated that they would still prefer to use traditional PIP (Picture in Picture) or live captions similar to Youtube auto captions for their satisfaction of accessibility. There are some negative feedbacks about the buggy, unreachable functions are not consistent to interact with is their major concern and providing several suggestions such as providing a professional team to develop with more UI and UX testing.<br>When asked about the customization of captions preference, half of our participants unanimously agreed that it is necessary to exist for more flexibility. Comments entailed:</p><table>    <tr>        <td><i>“I see why your tool needs to offer captions preferences, and it is sometimes necessary for … colorblind viewers, who have difficulty seeing a specific color and must alter their best color for watching experience.”</i></td>    </tr></table><table>    <tr>        <td><i>“I like the captions preference options… (but I) don't like the white font with black background, so I simply change the background to green, now it works much better for me.”</i></td>    </tr></table><p>The customizable implementation of sign interpreter window had more positive response than the closed captions preference. One participant commented:</p><table>    <tr>        <td><i>“The draggable signer window is fantastic…However, I believe the drop-down choice is worded incorrectly…(and) you mixed in the signer enable options and background color…(So) consider separating them and giving them their own icons and functions on the media controller.”</i></td>    </tr></table><p>Taken together, these findings suggest that there is an association between the complexity of the user interface as well as its unfriendliness to inexperienced computer users. Some participants took longer than others to figure out how the tool worked and needed further guidance and explanation for the research itself. Eventually they managed to figure it out on their own. The sign interpreter window received far more positive feedback, but it required further testing and tweaking on the drop-down menu to provide the optimal message to the user.</p><p>The next section of the open-ended discussion is the transparency function. We noticed that it might not have been the most functional part of the software on specific areas of certain videos. When the transparency of sign interpreter windows with no background color were mentioned, two third of our participants gave it a thumbs down to the transparency because of the busy background that made it hard for the user to see. Furthermore, when clicking on a background screen color for the interpreter, transparency was not available to serve that function.</p><p><img src="/images/CIA,figure3.3.png" title="Figure 3.3: 50% of Transparency of Each Sign Interpreter "></p><p>In the figure 3.3 above where the interpreter on the left is mixed with white font, it is difficult to see what the sign interpreter is signing. Additionally, the interpreter on the right with a dark busy background, is just as very difficult to decipher. Another participant, when asked for the transparency function, said:</p><table>    <tr>        <td><i>“It (transparency) looks cool at first, but when I enter Fullscreen mode and activate it with 50% opacity to apply the Oscar video and another one with gas prices in Los Angeles, it is difficult to view. So, in my perspective, I do not recommend providing transparency.”</i></td>    </tr></table><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>A new form of media accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing community has been necessary and crucial. We hoped to have not only reached that new form, but created a new standard of the needs of the community. For a long time, the DHH community has been left out of information and communication in the media. Ableplayer aims to give the community better access to information and communication from a variety of media beyond news programs and give the user control and options to accommodate best to their language needs.</p><p>We found that many people did indeed like the customizable closed interpreting implementation over the traditional interpreting service. However, there were several survey results and feedback that contradicted each other. In general, there was a noticeable and significant increase in satisfaction, understanding and ease of viewing from participant’s feedback. Participants also preferred the interpreting features that allow for resizing and relocating the interpreter video in the customizable implementation, but the transparency feature was not well-received.</p><p>There will always be more that can be achieved when it comes to accessibility for the Deaf and hard of hearing community, the solution is not one-size fits all. Our tool brought something new to the table and was able to create discourse on how it can improve to achieve greater quality accessibility.</p><h3 id="Future-Work"><a href="#Future-Work" class="headerlink" title="Future Work"></a>Future Work</h3><p>Some limitations to consider for future work, the data we obtained contains only 10 participants for the time being, all of who were Deaf, hard of hearing or hearing and ages 18-34 years. There is a need to obtain a larger sample size and demographic variability so that the data can be generalizable. Some survey questions were difficult for participants to comprehend, and only a few Deaf people responded without asking for explanation in ASL. Led to nonsensical answers such as repeatedly choosing the answer ‘5’ to mean, strongly agree for all questions. We had originally planned to provide an ASL version on each survey question, however due to the time constraint, we were only able to provide in-person clarification given that the participant asked for it. There was potential researcher bias in that explanation of the testing process to each participant slightly differed as some participants asked for more clarification even though the research was aimed to study effectiveness and understanding of the tool independent from guidance.</p><p>Some participants were curious as to why there was a need for two interpreters of different races. The intention mainly served visual contrast purposes particularly for Deaf-blind users as well as the DHH community as a whole, due to the fact that the Deaf community in general is largely visually reliant in receiving information. It was taken into consideration that all of the participants more than likely understood the function to serve as a cultural representation purpose as both signers had different signing styles and dialects. For this reason, the demand for more diversity in this function was mentioned frequently and brought more questions. It would be necessary to have a variety of certified trained sign interpreters to record in order to add diverse signers of different nationalities, colors, and genders solely for representation purposes.</p><p>It is important to note some people found it hard to catch all the information from videos that had two people speaking. There was only one interpreter provided, switching back and forth between speakers and interpreting for two people. In the future we should work towards having more than one interpreter ready to ease communication and information delivery.</p><p>In the tool, the sign interpreter with no background color is achieved by exporting an alpha channel with WebM video format using the Premiere Pro video editor. It is possible to automate the conversion of video to no background by uploading the video clip to the ableplayer website. This is the most ideal solution in order to save more time and less workload. There were technological concerns that necessitated the assistance of additional UI and UX professional consultants and specialists, such as incorporating a new design style on a dropdown menu. A professional can provide far more beneficial recommendations. While working on this enormous project since 2014, more than three or four individuals are also encouraged to contribute to the future development of Ableplayer.</p><h3 id="Resources-Availability"><a href="#Resources-Availability" class="headerlink" title="Resources Availability"></a>Resources Availability</h3><p>All research data (including paper and electronic) will be treated with the utmost respect and confidentiality.
